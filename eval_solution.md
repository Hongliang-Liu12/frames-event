Thank you for providing the debugging output. It's incredibly helpful and immediately points to the core of the problem.

Your analysis is spot on. The issue isn't the post-processing, but the image preprocessing.

Here's the breakdown of what's happening and how to fix it:

The Root Cause: Mismatched Image Preprocessing
The debugging output shows that the highest object confidence scores are around 0.00025. Your script's confidence threshold is 0.001. Since 0.00025 is much smaller than 0.001, every single potential detection is discarded, resulting in "No detections were made."

This indicates that the image data being fed into the model during evaluation is in a different format or has a different value range than what the model was trained on and what predict_test.py uses. Models are very sensitive to this; even small differences in normalization can cause a massive drop in performance.

Let's compare the preprocessing steps:

1. predict_test.py (The Working Script)
This script performs a very clear, manual preprocessing pipeline:

Reads the image with cv2.imread(). The image is a NumPy array with values from 0-255.

Manually calculates the scale, resizes the image (cv2.resize), and creates a gray padded background (np.full).

Crucially, it keeps the image as a uint8 (0-255) array during the resize and padding.

It then transposes the dimensions from HWC to CHW.

Finally, it converts the NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor and calls .float(). This implicitly scales the image values from the 0-255 range to a 0.0-1.0 float range, but it happens after the geometric transformations.

2. new_eval.py (The Non-Working Script)
This script relies on functions from utils.utils:

Reads the image with cv2.imread() and converts it to a PIL Image (Image.fromarray).

It calls resize_image(img_pil, (640, 640), True).

It then immediately calls preprocess_input(np.array(image_data, dtype=np.float32)). This is the problem. The preprocess_input function likely normalizes the image (e.g., divides by 255, subtracts mean, etc.) before it gets padded or handled by the DataLoader.

The slight difference in when and how the normalization and type conversion happens is causing the model to receive data in an unexpected format, leading to near-zero confidence scores.

The Solution: Replicate predict_test.py Preprocessing
To fix this, we will modify the letterbox_collate_fn in new_eval.py to exactly replicate the manual preprocessing from predict_test.py, ignoring the functions from utils.utils for this part.

Here is the final, corrected version of new_eval.py. Replace your entire file with this code.
